```

<h4 id="submit-an-issue">Run the script by the issue of GitHub</h4>

**Issues** >> **New issue** >> Fill in the title and description of the issue >> **Submit new issue**

#### Description:
```
- 原文网址：[原文标题](https://www.freeCodeCamp.org/news/路由/)
- MarkDown 文件：https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news-translation/edit/master/chinese/articles/文章文件名称.md
```
Replace `原文标题` with the original title. And replace `路由` and `文章文件名称` with the route of the article.

#### e.g.
If the URL of an article is `https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/Example/`, and its title is `Example Title`.

*Description:*
```
- 原文网址：[Example Title](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/Example/)
- MarkDown 文件：https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news-translation/edit/master/chinese/articles/Example.md
```

If you want to confirm whether the script is executed successfully, you can check the execution result of **Actions**, or check the existence of the file at the location you set in the option `markDownFilePath`. If you do not configure the option `markDownFilePath`, the file is generated in the current path by default.

If the script execution **fails**, you need to confirm the problem, solve them, and post a **new issue** according to the previous steps. In the **Action log**, The [*Common Error Messages*](#CommonErrorMessages) will give you some reliable tips.
